/*
 * recovery_dates.h
 *
 * What the recovery does about certificate dates while the clock is unknown.
 * mbedTLS checks them (the build has MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE for the TLS engine), but this module
 * has no battery clock: until SNTP has run, time() is near 1970 and every certificate looks "not yet
 * valid". A recovery must still reach its server then, as it did before dates were checked; the manifest
 * is signed, so what the server sends is checked in any case. Once the clock is valid, dates count.
 *
 * Free of ESP-IDF and mbedTLS, so software/test/recovery_dates tests what ships. recovery.c asserts that
 * the flag values below are mbedTLS's.

/* The clock can be trusted for certificate dates: SNTP has set it, or it reads at least the floor. A time() at or after
   the floor comes from SNTP, from the RTC time the S3 keeps over a soft restart (SNTP has not run again yet), or from
   the Ultimate's SNTP time that tls_set_clock() (software/wifi/tls/tls_engine.c) sets with settimeofday() at an OPEN. A
   wrong but plausible time only makes the recovery stricter: it can turn a date check on, never off, and a certificate
   that does not fit it fails as it would on any machine with that clock.
   The floor is 2024-01-01 here, a fixed date; the TLS engine's floor is the firmware's build time, which is static in
   tls_engine.c. The two are not shared: the engine's moves with every build and recovery has to work from the oldest
   image it may meet. */
